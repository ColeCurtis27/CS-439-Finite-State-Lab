# CS-439-Finite-State-Lab

Introduction:
This is a short choose your own adventure game I have created using Twine. You are a knight who wakes up stuck in an apple tree, and you must make your way back to the castle.

Technical Framework I Used:
I used Twine for this because I figured it would be the easiest for me to see the way nodes intereact with each other which in turn makes it easy to visualize the state changing from passage to passage.

How to Install and Run Project:
The easiest way I've found to run this project is to install the zip file of the repo. Then go to that file and open up the CS 439 Finite State Lab.html file in your web browser, and you should be able to run the story directly in your browser this way and play through the story.

How Each Node is Stored:
Each node is stored as a "passage" in twine. In twine, you don't write any actual html code. The passages or nodes you create and converted into html code by Twine.

Switching Between Nodes:
Switching between nodes is also very easy in this. You switch nodes when the player clicks on one fo the blue options at the end of the passage. This will change the text on the screen to the text of the new passage, and the user will be presented with new options for nodes to travel to.

Reflection on What I Learned:
What I learned is that even with a simple game like this, it can be hard to keep track of how you progress to different nodes. Luckily in Twine, they give you a visual space to view all your individual passages and arrow linking all of the ones that interact with each other. I can spread it out however I want to make it as easy as possible to understand and follow. If I wasn't writing this in a tool like twine that doesn't have that visual space for me, then I would want some way to leep track of the nodes myself. I could draw my own web or have a spreadsheet showing the choices more laid out and easier to go over. Keeping track of state change and all your nodes can get very difficult very quickly, but the idea of state change is so powerful when creating games. Something as simple as the player choosing what path to go down makes a very interesting choice for them, and all I'm doing as the programmer is sending them to a different node.

Parts I'm Proud Of:
I think the ending of the story being decided on what pizza toppings you choose was funny and made me laugh as I was writing it, so I would probably say that.

Things I Would Have Liked to Get to:
Adding sound effects or pictures would have been very nice in a game like this, and it's something I would've done if I had more time.
